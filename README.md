# Small Data 2014

In 2013, I was dissatisfied with how I got things done. I felt like I wasn't using much of my leisure time, like I was frittering it away on silly and stupid things. To resolve that problem, I attempted to track the activities I performed in 2014. This project is an investigation into some data obtained from personal records. 
There are even charts!

In a future iteration, I might mess around with some modeling, in an attempt to predict *something* about the data set.
